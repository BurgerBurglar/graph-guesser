# Graph Guesser

[A fun (for me) game](https://graph-guesser.shuo-tian.me/) to answer questions and learn more about the world.

## Notice

- There isn't a universal agreement on what defines a country. This game uses data from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), and I don't personally agree or disagree with their interpretations.
- Borders are not agreed upon everywhere. This game uses maps from [Datawrapper](https://app.datawrapper.de/), and I don't personally agree or disagree with their maps, and I do not agree or disagree with their maps personally.
- The game reflects the world as it is, which might include things some people find uncomfortable. Please use it thoughtfully.
- Be respectful to all countries and don't use this game to make fun of them.

## Anti-cheat

None. Your results won't be stored on the database. You can go back to the previous questions after finishing a game. In fact, you can refresh the page after submitting your answer.

## Contribution

If you find a bug, an inaccurate plot, a bad quiz, or an incorrect answer, please raise an issue [here](https://github.com/BurgerBurglar/graph-guesser/issues). If you would like to create a new quiz, create a visualization on [Datawrapper](https://app.datawrapper.de/) first, and create a PR to update the [data.ts](https://github.com/BurgerBurglar/graph-guesser/blob/main/src/data.ts) file.
